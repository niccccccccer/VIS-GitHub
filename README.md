# Visual Analytics System for GitHub



We designed and developed a visual analytics system for GitHub repositories that helps developers quickly understand and explore repositories, focusing on the most valuable information: pull requests.

The system consists of four views. 

- Basic introduction view: provides a brief overview of the repository. 
- Timeline view: shows the number of stars, forks, and pull requests over time. 
- Pull request view: implement advanced techniques such as semantic search and dimensionality reduction, making it easy for users to find similar pull requests and explore their differences. 
-  Code view: uses treemaps to display the repositoryâ€™s structure, with node size and color indicating the number of modifications. 

The system provides developers with a powerful tool for exploring and understanding code repositories, contributing to the improvement of the open source community.
